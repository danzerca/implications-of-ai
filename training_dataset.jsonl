\nSYSTEMS WORK FOR \nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE \nOCTOBER 2022", "6f38f45c-ee62-4e28-a3e6-2e9a2a13e9f6": "About this Document \nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American People was \npublished by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in October 2022. This framework was \nreleased one year after OSTP announced the launch of a process to develop \u201ca bill of rights for an AI-powered \nworld.\u201d Its release follows a year of public engagement to inform this initiative. The framework is available \nonline at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights \nAbout the Office of Science and Technology Policy \nThe Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by the National Science and Technology \nPolicy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to provide the President and others within the Executive Office \nof the President with advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of the economy, national \nsecurity, health, foreign relations, the environment, and the technological recovery and use of resources, among \nother topics. OSTP leads interagency science and technology policy coordination efforts, assists the Office of \nManagement and Budget (OMB) with an annual review and analysis of Federal research and development in \nbudgets, and serves as a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the President with \nrespect to major policies, plans, and programs of the Federal Government. \nLegal Disclaimer \nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American People is a white paper \npublished by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. It is intended to support the \ndevelopment of policies and practices that protect civil rights and promote democratic values in the building, \ndeployment, and governance of automated systems. \nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is non-binding and does not constitute U.S. government policy. It \ndoes not supersede, modify, or direct an interpretation of any existing statute, regulation, policy, or \ninternational instrument. It does not constitute binding guidance for the public or Federal agencies and \ntherefore does not require compliance with the principles described herein. It also is not determinative of what \nthe U.S. government\u2019s position will be in any international negotiation. Adoption of these principles may not \nmeet the requirements of existing statutes, regulations, policies, or international instruments, or the \nrequirements of the Federal agencies that enforce them. These principles are not intended to, and do not, \nprohibit or limit any lawful activity of a government agency, including law enforcement, national security, or \nintelligence activities. \nThe appropriate application of the principles set forth in this white paper depends significantly on the \ncontext in which automated systems are being utilized. In some circumstances, application of these principles \nin whole or in part may not be appropriate given the intended use of automated systems to achieve government \nagency missions. Future sector-specific guidance will likely be necessary and important for guiding the use of \nautomated systems in certain settings such as AI systems used as part of school building security or automated \nhealth diagnostic systems. \nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights recognizes that law enforcement activities require a balancing of \nequities, for example, between the protection of sensitive law enforcement information and the principle of \nnotice; as such, notice may not be appropriate, or may need to be adjusted to protect sources, methods, and \nother law enforcement equities. Even in contexts where these principles may not apply in whole or in part, \nfederal departments and agencies remain subject to judicial, privacy, and civil liberties oversight as well as \nexisting policies and safeguards that govern automated systems, including, for example, Executive Order 13960, \nPromoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government (December 2020). \nThis white paper recognizes that national security (which includes certain law enforcement and \nhomeland security activities) and defense activities are of increased sensitivity and interest to our nation\u2019s \nadversaries and are often subject to special requirements, such as those governing classified information and \nother protected data. Such activities require alternative, compatible safeguards through existing policies that \ngovern automated systems and AI, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) AI Ethical Principles and \nResponsible AI Implementation Pathway and the Intelligence Community (IC) AI Ethics Principles and \nFramework. The implementation of these policies to national security and defense activities can be informed by \nthe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights where feasible. \nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is not intended to, and does not, create any legal right, benefit, or \ndefense, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its \ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person, nor does it constitute a \nwaiver of sovereign immunity. \nCopyright Information \nThis document is a work of the United States Government and is in the public domain (see 17 U.S.C. \u00a7105). \n2", "439b2e2e-6276-4e9a-9626-8c7f83a73540": "SECTION TITLE\u00ad\nFOREWORD\nAmong the great challenges posed to democracy today is the use of technology, data, and automated systems in \nways that threaten the rights of the American public. Too often, these tools are used to limit our opportunities and \nprevent our access to critical resources or services. These problems are well documented. In America and around \nthe world, systems supposed to help with patient care have proven unsafe, ineffective, or biased. Algorithms used \nin hiring and credit decisions have been found to reflect and reproduce existing unwanted inequities or embed \nnew harmful bias and discrimination. Unchecked social media data collection has been used to threaten people\u2019s \nopportunities, undermine their privacy, or pervasively track their activity\u2014often without their knowledge or \nconsent. \nThese outcomes are deeply harmful\u2014but they are not inevitable. Automated systems have brought about extraor-\ndinary benefits, from technology that helps farmers grow food more efficiently and computers that predict storm \npaths, to algorithms that can identify diseases in patients. These tools now drive important decisions across \nsectors, while data is helping to revolutionize global industries. Fueled by the power of American innovation, \nthese tools hold the potential to redefine every part of our society and make life better for everyone. \nThis important progress must not come at the price of civil rights or democratic values, foundational American \nprinciples that President Biden has affirmed as a cornerstone of his Administration. On his first day in office, the \nPresident ordered the full Federal government to work to root out inequity, embed fairness in decision-\nmaking processes, and affirmatively advance civil rights, equal opportunity, and racial justice in America.1 The \nPresident has spoken forcefully about the urgent challenges posed to democracy today and has regularly called \non people of conscience to act to preserve civil rights\u2014including the right to privacy, which he has called \u201cthe \nbasis for so many more rights that we have come to take for granted that are ingrained in the fabric of this \ncountry.\u201d2\nTo advance President Biden\u2019s vision, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has identified \nfive principles that should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American \npublic in the age of artificial intelligence. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a guide for a society that \nprotects all people from these threats\u2014and uses technologies in ways that reinforce our highest values. \nResponding to the experiences of the American public, and informed by insights from researchers, \ntechnologists, advocates, journalists, and policymakers, this framework is accompanied by a technical \ncompanion\u2014a handbook for anyone seeking to incorporate these protections into policy and practice, including \ndetailed steps toward actualizing these principles in the technological design process. These principles help \nprovide guidance whenever automated systems can meaningfully impact the public\u2019s rights, opportunities, \nor access to critical needs. \n3", "19181980-65ab-44c3-b520-b8d9dc88ac82": "ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a set of five principles and associated practices to help guide the \ndesign, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the rights of the American public in the age of \nartificial intel-ligence. Developed through extensive consultation with the American public, these principles are \na blueprint for building and deploying automated systems that are aligned with democratic values and protect \ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights includes this Foreword, the five \nprinciples, notes on Applying the The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, and a Technical Companion that gives \nconcrete steps that can be taken by many kinds of organizations\u2014from governments at all levels to companies of \nall sizes\u2014to uphold these values. Experts from across the private sector, governments, and international \nconsortia have published principles and frameworks to guide the responsible use of automated systems; this \nframework provides a national values statement and toolkit that is sector-agnostic to inform building these \nprotections into policy, practice, or the technological design process.  Where existing law or policy\u2014such as \nsector-specific privacy laws and oversight requirements\u2014do not already provide guidance, the Blueprint for an \nAI Bill of Rights should be used to inform policy decisions.\nLISTENING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has led a year-long process to seek and distill input \nfrom people across the country\u2014from impacted communities and industry stakeholders to technology develop-\ners and other experts across fields and sectors, as well as policymakers throughout the Federal government\u2014on \nthe issue of algorithmic and data-driven harms and potential remedies. Through panel discussions, public listen-\ning sessions, meetings, a formal request for information, and input to a publicly accessible and widely-publicized \nemail address, people throughout the United States, public servants across Federal agencies, and members of the \ninternational community spoke up about both the promises and potential harms of these technologies, and \nplayed a central role in shaping the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The core messages gleaned from these \ndiscussions include that AI has transformative potential to improve Americans\u2019 lives, and that preventing the \nharms of these technologies is both necessary and achievable. The Appendix includes a full list of public engage-\nments. \n4", "401efc61-9ca1-4864-9980-a5d2b71cf240": "AI BILL OF RIGHTS\nFFECTIVE SYSTEMS\nineffective systems.

Algorithmic discrimination occurs when automated systems contribute to unjustified \ndifferent treatment or impacts disfavoring people based on their race, color, ethnicity, sex (including \npregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other \nclassification protected by law. Depending on the specific circumstances, such algorithmic discrimination \nmay violate legal protections. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should take \nproactive \nand \ncontinuous \nmeasures \nto \nprotect \nindividuals \nand \ncommunities \nfrom algorithmic \ndiscrimination and to use and design systems in an equitable way. This protection should include proactive \nequity assessments as part of the system design, use of representative data and protection against proxies \nfor demographic features, ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities in design and development, \npre-deployment and ongoing disparity testing and mitigation, and clear organizational oversight. Independent \nevaluation and plain language reporting in the form of an algorithmic impact assessment, including \ndisparity testing results and mitigation information, should be performed and made public whenever \npossible to confirm these protections. \n5", "6469d967-e045-4a88-a2bb-b777f1ff65bc": "SECTION TITLE\nDATA PRIVACY\nYou should be protected from abusive data practices via built-in protections and you \nshould have agency over how data about you is used. You should be protected from violations of \nprivacy through design choices that ensure such protections are included by default, including ensuring that \ndata collection conforms to reasonable expectations and that only data strictly necessary for the specific \ncontext is collected. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems should seek your permission \nand respect your decisions regarding collection, use, access, transfer, and deletion of your data in appropriate \nways and to the greatest extent possible; where not possible, alternative privacy by design safeguards should be \nused. Systems should not employ user experience and design decisions that obfuscate user choice or burden \nusers with defaults that are privacy invasive. Consent should only be used to justify collection of data in cases \nwhere it can be appropriately and meaningfully given. Any consent requests should be brief, be understandable \nin plain language, and give you agency over data collection and the specific context of use; current hard-to\u00ad\nunderstand notice-and-choice practices for broad uses of data should be changed. Enhanced protections and \nrestrictions for data and inferences related to sensitive domains, including health, work, education, criminal \njustice, and finance, and for data pertaining to youth should put you first. In sensitive domains, your data and \nrelated inferences should only be used for necessary functions, and you should be protected by ethical review \nand use prohibitions. You and your communities should be free from unchecked surveillance; surveillance \ntechnologies should be subject to heightened oversight that includes at least pre-deployment assessment of their \npotential harms and scope limits to protect privacy and civil liberties. Continuous surveillance and monitoring \nshould not be used in education, work, housing, or in other contexts where the use of such surveillance \ntechnologies is likely to limit rights, opportunities, or access. Whenever possible, you should have access to \nreporting that confirms your data decisions have been respected and provides an assessment of the \npotential impact of surveillance technologies on your rights, opportunities, or access. \nNOTICE AND EXPLANATION\nYou should know that an automated system is being used and understand how and why it \ncontributes to outcomes that impact you. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated systems \nshould provide generally accessible plain language documentation including clear descriptions of the overall \nsystem functioning and the role automation plays, notice that such systems are in use, the individual or organiza\u00ad\ntion responsible for the system, and explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible. Such notice \nshould be kept up-to-date and people impacted by the system should be notified of significant use case or key \nfunctionality changes. You should know how and why an outcome impacting you was determined by an \nautomated system, including when the automated system is not the sole input determining the outcome. \nAutomated systems should provide explanations that are technically valid, meaningful and useful to you and to \nany operators or others who need to understand the system, and calibrated to the level of risk based on the \ncontext. Reporting that includes summary information about these automated systems in plain language and \nassessments of the clarity and quality of the notice and explanations should be made public whenever possible. \n6", "36ed0165-bacb-4825-86e0-599beb89bb66": "SECTION TITLE\nHUMAN ALTERNATIVES, CONSIDERATION, AND FALLBACK\nYou should be able to opt out, where appropriate, and have access to a person who can quickly \nconsider and remedy problems you encounter. You should be able to opt out from automated systems in \nfavor of a human alternative, where appropriate. Appropriateness should be determined based on reasonable \nexpectations in a given context and with a focus on ensuring broad accessibility and protecting the public from \nespecially harmful impacts. In some cases, a human or other alternative may be required by law. You should have \naccess to timely human consideration and remedy by a fallback and escalation process if an automated system \nfails, it produces an error, or you would like to appeal or contest its impacts on you. Human consideration and \nfallback should be accessible, equitable, effective, maintained, accompanied by appropriate operator training, and \nshould not impose an unreasonable burden on the public. Automated systems with an intended use within sensi\u00ad\ntive domains, including, but not limited to, criminal justice, employment, education, and health, should additional\u00ad\nly be tailored to the purpose, provide meaningful access for oversight, include training for any people interacting \nwith the system, and incorporate human consideration for adverse or high-risk decisions. Reporting that includes \na description of these human governance processes and assessment of their timeliness, accessibility, outcomes, \nand effectiveness should be made public whenever possible. \nDefinitions for key terms in The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights can be found in Applying the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. \nAccompanying analysis and tools for actualizing each principle can be found in the Technical Companion. \n7", "5f2689a2-a74a-445a-9882-3749b835e8f8": "SECTION TITLE\nApplying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nWhile many of the concerns addressed in this framework derive from the use of AI, the technical \ncapabilities and specific definitions of such systems change with the speed of innovation, and the potential \nharms of their use occur even with less technologically sophisticated tools. Thus, this framework uses a two-\npart test to determine what systems are in scope. This framework applies to (1) automated systems that (2) \nhave the potential to meaningfully impact the American public\u2019s rights, opportunities, or access to \ncritical resources or services. These rights, opportunities, and access to critical resources of services should \nbe enjoyed equally and be fully protected, regardless of the changing role that automated systems may play in \nour lives. \nThis framework describes protections that should be applied with respect to all automated systems that \nhave the potential to meaningfully impact individuals' or communities' exercise of: \nRIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR ACCESS\nCivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy, including freedom of speech, voting, and protections from discrimi\u00ad\nnation, excessive punishment, unlawful surveillance, and violations of privacy and other freedoms in both \npublic and private sector contexts; \nEqual opportunities, including equitable access to education, housing, credit, employment, and other \nprograms; or, \nAccess to critical resources or services, such as healthcare, financial services, safety, social services, \nnon-deceptive information about goods and services, and government benefits. \nA list of examples of automated systems for which these principles should be considered is provided in the \nAppendix. The Technical Companion, which follows, offers supportive guidance for any person or entity that \ncreates, deploys, or oversees automated systems. \nConsidered together, the five principles and associated practices of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of \nRights form an overlapping set of backstops against potential harms. This purposefully overlapping \nframework, when taken as a whole, forms a blueprint to help protect the public from harm. \nThe measures taken to realize the vision set forward in this framework should be proportionate \nwith the extent and nature of the harm, or risk of harm, to people's rights, opportunities, and \naccess. \nRELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW AND POLICY\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is an exercise in envisioning a future where the American public is \nprotected from the potential harms, and can fully enjoy the benefits, of automated systems. It describes princi\u00ad\nples that can help ensure these protections. Some of these protections are already required by the U.S. Constitu\u00ad\ntion or implemented under existing U.S. laws. For example, government surveillance, and data search and \nseizure are subject to legal requirements and judicial oversight. There are Constitutional requirements for \nhuman review of criminal investigative matters and statutory requirements for judicial review. Civil rights laws \nprotect the American people against discrimination. \n8", "9c8f20f0-1d7f-4c73-8ada-e0b6452ca39f": "SECTION TITLE\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nRELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW AND POLICY\nThere are regulatory safety requirements for medical devices, as well as sector-, population-, or technology-spe\u00ad\ncific privacy and security protections. Ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework \nwould require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted. In some cases, exceptions to \nthe principles described in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights may be necessary to comply with existing law, \nconform to the practicalities of a specific use case, or balance competing public interests. In particular, law \nenforcement, and other regulatory contexts may require government actors to protect civil rights, civil liberties, \nand privacy in a manner consistent with, but using alternate mechanisms to, the specific principles discussed in \nthis framework. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is meant to assist governments and the private sector in \nmoving principles into practice. \nThe expectations given in the Technical Companion are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of \nadditional technical standards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts. While \nexisting laws informed the development of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, this framework does not detail \nthose laws beyond providing them as examples, where appropriate, of existing protective measures. This \nframework instead shares a broad, forward-leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system \ndevelopment and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the poten\u00ad\ntial to meaningfully impact rights, opportunities, or access. Additionally, this framework does not analyze or \ntake a position on legislative and regulatory proposals in municipal, state, and federal government, or those in \nother countries. \nWe have seen modest progress in recent years, with some state and local governments responding to these prob\u00ad\nlems with legislation, and some courts extending longstanding statutory protections to new and emerging tech\u00ad\nnologies. There are companies working to incorporate additional protections in their design and use of auto\u00ad\nmated systems, and researchers developing innovative guardrails. Advocates, researchers, and government \norganizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems. These include \nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD\u2019s) 2019 Recommendation on Artificial \nIntelligence, which includes principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and which the United \nStates adopted, and Executive Order 13960 on Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the \nFederal Government, which sets out principles that govern the federal government\u2019s use of AI. The Blueprint \nfor an AI Bill of Rights is fully consistent with these principles and with the direction in Executive Order 13985 \non Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. \nThese principles find kinship in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), derived from the 1973 report \nof an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Records, Computers, \nand the Rights of Citizens.4 While there is no single, universal articulation of the FIPPs, these core \nprinciples for managing information about individuals have been incorporated into data privacy laws and \npolicies across the globe.5 The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights embraces elements of the FIPPs that are \nparticularly relevant to automated systems, without articulating a specific set of FIPPs or scoping \napplicability or the interests served to a single particular domain, like privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, \nethics, or risk management. The Technical Companion builds on this prior work to provide practical next \nsteps to move these principles into practice and promote common approaches that allow technological \ninnovation to flourish while protecting people from harm. \n9", "8119f527-5596-4002-b70f-6d6ee7c2e34f": "Applying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nDEFINITIONS\nALGORITHMIC DISCRIMINATION: \u201cAlgorithmic discrimination\u201d occurs when automated systems \ncontribute to unjustified different treatment or impacts disfavoring people based on their race, color, ethnicity, \nsex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifica-\ntion protected by law. Depending on the specific circumstances, such algorithmic discrimination may violate \nlegal protections. Throughout this framework the term \u201calgorithmic discrimination\u201d takes this meaning (and \nnot a technical understanding of discrimination as distinguishing between items). \nAUTOMATED SYSTEM: An \"automated system\" is any system, software, or process that uses computation as \nwhole or part of a system to determine outcomes, make or aid decisions, inform policy implementation, collect \ndata or observations, or otherwise interact with individuals and/or communities. Automated systems \ninclude, but are not limited to, systems derived from machine learning, statistics, or other data processing \nor artificial intelligence techniques, and exclude passive computing infrastructure. \u201cPassive computing \ninfrastructure\u201d is any intermediary technology that does not influence or determine the outcome of decision, \nmake or aid in decisions, inform policy implementation, or collect data or observations, including web \nhosting, domain registration, networking, caching, data storage, or cybersecurity. Throughout this \nframework, automated systems that are considered in scope are only those that have the potential to \nmeaningfully impact individuals\u2019 or communi-ties\u2019 rights, opportunities, or access. \nCOMMUNITIES: \u201cCommunities\u201d include: neighborhoods; social network connections (both online and \noffline); families (construed broadly); people connected by affinity, identity, or shared traits; and formal organi-\nzational ties. This includes Tribes, Clans, Bands, Rancherias, Villages, and other Indigenous communities. AI \nand other data-driven automated systems most directly collect data on, make inferences about, and may cause \nharm to individuals. But the overall magnitude of their impacts may be most readily visible at the level of com-\nmunities. Accordingly, the concept of community is integral to the scope of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. \nUnited States law and policy have long employed approaches for protecting the rights of individuals, but exist-\ning frameworks have sometimes struggled to provide protections when effects manifest most clearly at a com-\nmunity level. For these reasons, the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights asserts that the harms of automated \nsystems should be evaluated, protected against, and redressed at both the individual and community levels. \nEQUITY: \u201cEquity\u201d means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals. \nSystemic, fair, and just treatment must take into account the status of individuals who belong to underserved \ncommunities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American \npersons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; \nwomen, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) \npersons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely \naffected by persistent poverty or inequality. \nRIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR ACCESS: \u201cRights, opportunities, or access\u201d is used to indicate the scoping \nof this framework. It describes the set of: civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy, including freedom of speech, \nvoting, and protections from discrimination, excessive punishment, unlawful surveillance, and violations of \nprivacy and other freedoms in both public and private sector contexts; equal opportunities, including equitable \naccess to education, housing, credit, employment, and other programs; or, access to critical resources or \nservices, such as healthcare, financial services, safety, social services, non-deceptive information about goods \nand services, and government benefits. \n10", "1d159375-c97a-44c3-9cec-b8187812e657": "Applying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nSENSITIVE DATA: Data and metadata are sensitive if they pertain to an individual in a sensitive domain \n(defined below); are generated by technologies used in a sensitive domain; can be used to infer data from a \nsensitive domain or sensitive data about an individual (such as disability-related data, genomic data, biometric \ndata, behavioral data, geolocation data, data related to interaction with the criminal justice system, relationship \nhistory and legal status such as custody and divorce information, and home, work, or school environmental \ndata); or have the reasonable potential to be used in ways that are likely to expose individuals to meaningful \nharm, such as a loss of privacy or financial harm due to identity theft. Data and metadata generated by or about \nthose who are not yet legal adults is also sensitive, even if not related to a sensitive domain. Such data includes, \nbut is not limited to, numerical, text, image, audio, or video data. \nSENSITIVE DOMAINS: \u201cSensitive domains\u201d are those in which activities being conducted can cause material \nharms, including significant adverse effects on human rights such as autonomy and dignity, as well as civil liber\u00ad\nties and civil rights.

These expectations are explained below. \nProtect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner \nConsultation. The public should be consulted in the design, implementation, deployment, acquisition, and \nmaintenance phases of automated system development, with emphasis on early-stage consultation before a \nsystem is introduced or a large change implemented. This consultation should directly engage diverse impact\u00ad\ned communities to consider concerns and risks that may be unique to those communities, or disproportionate\u00ad\nly prevalent or severe for them. The extent of this engagement and the form of outreach to relevant stakehold\u00ad\ners may differ depending on the specific automated system and development phase, but should include \nsubject matter, sector-specific, and context-specific experts as well as experts on potential impacts such as \ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy experts. For private sector applications, consultations before product \nlaunch may need to be confidential. Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or \napplications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based \non system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation \nshould be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should \nbe reconsidered based on this feedback. \nTesting. Systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment. This testing should follow \ndomain-specific best practices, when available, for ensuring the technology will work in its real-world \ncontext. Such testing should take into account both the specific technology used and the roles of any human \noperators or reviewers who impact system outcomes or effectiveness; testing should include both automated \nsystems testing and human-led (manual) testing. Testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the \nconditions in which the system will be deployed, and new testing may be required for each deployment to \naccount for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another. Following testing, system \nperformance should be compared with the in-place, potentially human-driven, status quo procedures, with \nexisting human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre-deployment, \nand as a lifecycle minimum performance standard. Decision possibilities resulting from performance testing \nshould include the possibility of not deploying the system. \nRisk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten\u00ad\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the \npotential for meaningful impact on people\u2019s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted \ncommunities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of \nthe system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\u00ad\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention \nand mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating \nthe safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\u00ad\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi\u00ad\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system. \n18", "068ca2ee-f81c-4f86-be49-522d67a52970": "SAFE AND EFFECTIVE \nSYSTEMS \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nOngoing monitoring. Automated systems should have ongoing monitoring procedures, including recalibra\u00ad\ntion procedures, in place to ensure that their performance does not fall below an acceptable level over time, \nbased on changing real-world conditions or deployment contexts, post-deployment modification, or unexpect\u00ad\ned conditions. This ongoing monitoring should include continuous evaluation of performance metrics and \nharm assessments, updates of any systems, and retraining of any machine learning models as necessary, as well \nas ensuring that fallback mechanisms are in place to allow reversion to a previously working system. Monitor\u00ad\ning should take into account the performance of both technical system components (the algorithm as well as \nany hardware components, data inputs, etc.) and human operators. It should include mechanisms for testing \nthe actual accuracy of any predictions or recommendations generated by a system, not just a human operator\u2019s \ndetermination of their accuracy. Ongoing monitoring procedures should include manual, human-led monitor\u00ad\ning as a check in the event there are shortcomings in automated monitoring systems. These monitoring proce\u00ad\ndures should be in place for the lifespan of the deployed automated system. \nClear organizational oversight. Entities responsible for the development or use of automated systems \nshould lay out clear governance structures and procedures.  This includes clearly-stated governance proce\u00ad\ndures before deploying the system, as well as responsibility of specific individuals or entities to oversee ongoing \nassessment and mitigation. Organizational stakeholders including those with oversight of the business process \nor operation being automated, as well as other organizational divisions that may be affected due to the use of \nthe system, should be involved in establishing governance procedures. Responsibility should rest high enough \nin the organization that decisions about resources, mitigation, incident response, and potential rollback can be \nmade promptly, with sufficient weight given to risk mitigation objectives against competing concerns. Those \nholding this responsibility should be made aware of any use cases with the potential for meaningful impact on \npeople\u2019s rights, opportunities, or access as determined based on risk identification procedures.  In some cases, \nit may be appropriate for an independent ethics review to be conducted before deployment. \nAvoid inappropriate, low-quality, or irrelevant data use and the compounded harm of its \nreuse \nRelevant and high-quality data.

Relevance of data should not be established solely by appealing to \nits historical connection to the outcome. High quality and tailored data should be representative of the task at \nhand and errors from data entry or other sources should be measured and limited. Any data used as the target \nof a prediction process should receive particular attention to the quality and validity of the predicted outcome \nor label to ensure the goal of the automated system is appropriately identified and measured. Additionally, \njustification should be documented for each data attribute and source to explain why it is appropriate to use \nthat data to inform the results of the automated system and why such use will not violate any applicable laws. \nIn cases of high-dimensional and/or derived attributes, such justifications can be provided as overall \ndescriptions of the attribute generation process and appropriateness. \n19", "64c57121-b2b0-4558-b17c-eec662910950": "SAFE AND EFFECTIVE \nSYSTEMS \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nDerived data sources tracked and reviewed carefully. Data that is derived from other data through \nthe use of algorithms, such as data derived or inferred from prior model outputs, should be identified and \ntracked, e.g., via a specialized type in a data schema. Derived data should be viewed as potentially high-risk \ninputs that may lead to feedback loops, compounded harm, or inaccurate results. Such sources should be care\u00ad\nfully validated against the risk of collateral consequences. \nData reuse limits in sensitive domains. Data reuse, and especially data reuse in a new context, can result \nin the spreading and scaling of harms. Data from some domains, including criminal justice data and data indi\u00ad\ncating adverse outcomes in domains such as finance, employment, and housing, is especially sensitive, and in \nsome cases its reuse is limited by law. Accordingly, such data should be subject to extra oversight to ensure \nsafety and efficacy. Data reuse of sensitive domain data in other contexts (e.g., criminal data reuse for civil legal \nmatters or private sector use) should only occur where use of such data is legally authorized and, after examina\u00ad\ntion, has benefits for those impacted by the system that outweigh identified risks and, as appropriate, reason\u00ad\nable measures have been implemented to mitigate the identified risks. Such data should be clearly labeled to \nidentify contexts for limited reuse based on sensitivity. Where possible, aggregated datasets may be useful for \nreplacing individual-level sensitive data. \nDemonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the system \nIndependent evaluation. Automated systems should be designed to allow for independent evaluation (e.g., \nvia application programming interfaces). Independent evaluators, such as researchers, journalists, ethics \nreview boards, inspectors general, and third-party auditors, should be given access to the system and samples \nof associated data, in a manner consistent with privacy, security, law, or regulation (including, e.g., intellectual \nproperty law), in order to perform such evaluations.

Protection against algorithmic discrimination should include designing to ensure equity, broadly \nconstrued.  Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \ndesign, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the \nproxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, \norganizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely \nfor any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \n26\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections", "65b0249d-875a-451a-88f1-922dc2ca9561": "WHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nEnsuring accessibility during design, development, and deployment. Systems should be \ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\u00ad\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\u00ad\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\u00ad\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\u00ad\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\u00ad\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\u00ad\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \njustification for any continued use of the system. \nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \nthe disparity may be required by law. \nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\u00ad\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\u00ad\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \nresults is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how \ndemographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via \nqualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed \nmore frequently. Outcomes of this assessment should include additional disparity mitigation, if needed, or \nfallback to earlier procedures in the case that equity standards are no longer met and can't be mitigated, and \nprior mechanisms provide better adherence to equity standards. \n27\nAlgorithmic \nDiscrimination \nProtections", "3325b145-94fe-4f1c-8e2a-1e7c27362528": "WHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nDemonstrate that the system protects against algorithmic discrimination \nIndependent evaluation.

The Action Plan to Advance Property Appraisal and Valuation \nEquity includes a commitment from the agencies that oversee mortgage lending to include a \nnondiscrimination standard in the proposed rules for Automated Valuation Models.52\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice have clearly \nlaid out how employers\u2019 use of AI and other automated systems can result in \ndiscrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities.53 The documents explain \nhow employers\u2019 use of software that relies on algorithmic decision-making may violate existing requirements \nunder Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d). This technical assistance also provides practical \ntips to employers on how to comply with the ADA, and to job applicants and employees who think that their \nrights may have been violated. \nDisparity assessments identified harms to Black patients' healthcare access. A widely \nused healthcare algorithm relied on the cost of each patient\u2019s past medical care to predict future medical needs, \nrecommending early interventions for the patients deemed most at risk. This process discriminated \nagainst Black patients, who generally have less access to medical care and therefore have generated less cost \nthan white patients with similar illness and need. A landmark study documented this pattern and proposed \npractical ways that were shown to reduce this bias, such as focusing specifically on active chronic health \nconditions or avoidable future costs related to emergency visits and hospitalization.54 \nLarge employers have developed best practices to scrutinize the data and models used \nfor hiring. An industry initiative has developed Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured \nquestionnaire that businesses can use proactively when procuring software to evaluate workers. It covers \nspecific technical questions such as the training data used, model training process, biases identified, and \nmitigation steps employed.55 \nStandards organizations have developed guidelines to incorporate accessibility criteria \ninto technology design processes.

Surveil\u00ad\nlance and data collection, sharing, use, and reuse now sit at the foundation of business models across many industries, \nwith more and more companies tracking the behavior of the American public, building individual profiles based on \nthis data, and using this granular-level information as input into automated systems that further track, profile, and \nimpact the American public. Government agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, also use and help develop \na variety of technologies that enhance and expand surveillance capabilities, which similarly collect data used as input \ninto other automated systems that directly impact people\u2019s lives. Federal law has not grown to address the expanding \nscale of private data collection, or of the ability of governments at all levels to access that data and leverage the means \nof private collection.  \nMeanwhile, members of the American public are often unable to access their personal data or make critical decisions \nabout its collection and use. Data brokers frequently collect consumer data from numerous sources without \nconsumers\u2019 permission or knowledge.60 Moreover, there is a risk that inaccurate and faulty data can be used to \nmake decisions about their lives, such as whether they will qualify for a loan or get a job. Use of surveillance \ntechnologies has increased in schools and workplaces, and, when coupled with consequential management and \nevaluation decisions, it is leading to mental health harms such as lowered self-confidence, anxiety, depression, and \na reduced ability to use analytical reasoning.61 Documented patterns show that personal data is being aggregated by \ndata brokers to profile communities in harmful ways.62 The impact of all this data harvesting is corrosive, \nbreeding distrust, anxiety, and other mental health problems; chilling speech, protest, and worker organizing; and \nthreatening our democratic process.63 The American public should be protected from these growing risks. \nIncreasingly, some companies are taking these concerns seriously and integrating mechanisms to protect consumer \nprivacy into their products by design and by default, including by minimizing the data they collect, communicating \ncollection and use clearly, and improving security practices. Federal government surveillance and other collection and \nuse of data is governed by legal protections that help to protect civil liberties and provide for limits on data retention \nin some cases. Many states have also enacted consumer data privacy protection regimes to address some of these \nharms. \nHowever, these are not yet standard practices, and the United States lacks a comprehensive statutory or regulatory \nframework governing the rights of the public when it comes to personal data. While a patchwork of laws exists to \nguide the collection and use of personal data in specific contexts, including health, employment, education, and credit, \nit can be unclear how these laws apply in other contexts and in an increasingly automated society.

Automated systems should be designed and built with privacy protect\u00ad\ned by default. Privacy risks should be assessed throughout the development life cycle, including privacy risks \nfrom reidentification, and appropriate technical and policy mitigation measures should be implemented. This \nincludes potential harms to those who are not users of the automated system, but who may be harmed by \ninferred data, purposeful privacy violations, or community surveillance or other community harms.

User experience \nresearch should be conducted to confirm that people understand what data is being collected about them and \nhow it will be used, and that this collection matches their expectations and desires. \nData collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \nnarrow identified goals, to avoid \"mission creep.\"  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be \nstrictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible.

Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks \noutweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not \ninclude sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not \nreasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \nPrivacy-preserving security.

This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure \nthere is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a \nspecific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the \nsystem is in use. \nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary \nto achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of \nsurveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the \nminimum number of subjects possible.

Depending on the technological use case and \nbased on an ethical assessment, consent for sensitive data may need to be acquired from a guardian and/or child. \nProvide enhanced protections for data related to sensitive domains \nNecessary functions only. Sensitive data should only be used for functions strictly necessary for that \ndomain or for functions that are required for administrative reasons (e.g., school attendance records), unless \nconsent is acquired, if appropriate, and the additional expectations in this section are met. Consent for non-\nnecessary functions should be optional, i.e., should not be required, incentivized, or coerced in order to \nreceive opportunities or access to services. In cases where data is provided to an entity (e.g., health insurance \ncompany) in order to facilitate payment for such a need, that data should only be used for that purpose. \nEthical review and use prohibitions. Any use of sensitive data or decision process based in part on sensi-\ntive data that might limit rights, opportunities, or access, whether the decision is automated or not, should go \nthrough a thorough ethical review and monitoring, both in advance and by periodic review (e.g., via an indepen-\ndent ethics committee or similarly robust process). In some cases, this ethical review may determine that data \nshould not be used or shared for specific uses even with consent. Some novel uses of automated systems in this \ncontext, where the algorithm is dynamically developing and where the science behind the use case is not well \nestablished, may also count as human subject experimentation, and require special review under organizational \ncompliance bodies applying medical, scientific, and academic human subject experimentation ethics rules and \ngovernance procedures. \nData quality. In sensitive domains, entities should be especially careful to maintain the quality of data to \navoid adverse consequences arising from decision-making based on flawed or inaccurate data. Such care is \nnecessary in a fragmented, complex data ecosystem and for datasets that have limited access such as for fraud \nprevention and law enforcement. It should be not left solely to individuals to carry the burden of reviewing and \ncorrecting data. Entities should conduct regular, independent audits and take prompt corrective measures to \nmaintain accurate, timely, and complete data. \nLimit access to sensitive data and derived data. Sensitive data and derived data should not be sold, \nshared, or made public as part of data brokerage or other agreements. Sensitive data includes data that can be \nused to infer sensitive information; even systems that are not directly marketed as sensitive domain technologies \nare expected to keep sensitive data private. Access to such data should be limited based on necessity and based \non a principle of local control, such that those individuals closest to the data subject have more access while \nthose who are less proximate do not (e.g., a teacher has access to their students\u2019 daily progress data while a \nsuperintendent does not). \nReporting. In addition to the reporting on data privacy (as listed above for non-sensitive data), entities devel-\noping technologies related to a sensitive domain and those collecting, using, storing, or sharing sensitive data \nshould, whenever appropriate, regularly provide public reports describing: any data security lapses or breaches \nthat resulted in sensitive data leaks; the number, type, and outcomes of ethical pre-reviews undertaken; a \ndescription of any data sold, shared, or made public, and how that data was assessed to determine it did not pres-\nent a sensitive data risk; and ongoing risk identification and management procedures, and any mitigation added \nbased on these procedures.

Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is \u201crelevant and necessary\u201d to \naccomplish an agency\u2019s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows \nfor individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not \nincluded under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\u00ad\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular \nsystem of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. \nFurther, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \ncomply with the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or \ncorrect an individual\u2019s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, \nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual\u2019s \u201cqualifications, character, rights, \u2026 \nopportunities\u2026, or benefits.\u201d \nNIST\u2019s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for \norganizations to manage privacy risks.

It has been voluntarily adopted by organizations across many different sectors around the world.78\nA school board\u2019s attempt to surveil public school students\u2014undertaken without \nadequate community input\u2014sparked a state-wide biometrics moratorium.79 Reacting to a plan in \nthe city of Lockport, New York, the state\u2019s legislature banned the use of facial recognition systems and other \n\u201cbiometric identifying technology\u201d in schools until July 1, 2022.80 The law additionally requires that a report on \nthe privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties implications of the use of such technologies be issued before \nbiometric identification technologies can be used in New York schools. \nFederal law requires employers, and any consultants they may retain, to report the costs \nof surveilling employees in the context of a labor dispute, providing a transparency \nmechanism to help protect worker organizing. Employers engaging in workplace surveillance \"where \nan object there-of, directly or indirectly, is [\u2026] to obtain information concerning the activities of employees or a \nlabor organization in connection with a labor dispute\" must report expenditures relating to this surveillance to \nthe Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards, and consultants who employers retain for \nthese purposes must also file reports regarding their activities.81\nPrivacy choices on smartphones show that when technologies are well designed, privacy \nand data agency can be meaningful and not overwhelming.

Yet members of the public are often \npresented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once \nthey decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result \nof this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, \nand critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are \nmeaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\u00ad\nniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or \nother alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for people \nwith disabilities. \nIn addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback \nsystem in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is \ntested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human \nreview against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have \nto wait\u2014immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a \nremedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated \ncard access system fails. \nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems \nare used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors \ndiagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous \noutcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human \noversight in such settings. \nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to \nprovide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still \nin place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers \noften retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an \nairplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a \nmisidentification. \nThe American people deserve the reassurance that such procedures are in place to protect their rights, opportunities, \nand access.

Human consideration and fallback are only useful if they are conducted and concluded in a \ntimely manner. The determination of what is timely should be made relative to the specific automated \nsystem, and the review system should be staffed and regularly assessed to ensure it is providing timely \nconsideration and fallback. In time-critical systems, this mechanism should be immediately available or, \nwhere possible, available before the harm occurs.

Various panelists suggested that these harms could be \nmitigated by ensuring community input at the beginning of the design process, providing ways to opt out of \nthese systems and use associated human-driven mechanisms instead, ensuring timeliness of benefit payments, \nand providing clear notice about the use of these systems and clear explanations of how and what the \ntechnologies are doing. Some panelists suggested that technology should be used to help people receive \nbenefits, e.g., by pushing benefits to those in need and ensuring automated decision-making systems are only \nused to provide a positive outcome; technology shouldn't be used to take supports away from people who need \nthem. \nPanel 6: The Healthcare System.

Panelists discussed the increasing importance of tech-\nnology as both a vehicle to deliver healthcare and a tool to enhance the quality of care. On the issue of \ndelivery, various panelists pointed to a number of concerns including access to and expense of broadband \nservice, the privacy concerns associated with telehealth systems, the expense associated with health \nmonitoring devices, and how this can exacerbate equity issues.  On the issue of technology enhanced care, \nsome panelists spoke extensively about the way in which racial biases and the use of race in medicine \nperpetuate harms and embed prior discrimination, and the importance of ensuring that the technologies used \nin medical care were accountable to the relevant stakeholders. Various panelists emphasized the importance \nof having the voices of those subjected to these technologies be heard.\n59", "6de5009a-ce64-4085-89e8-f162731994e2": "APPENDIX\nSummaries of Additional Engagements: \n\u2022 OSTP created an email address (ai-equity@ostp.eop.gov) to solicit comments from the public on the use of\nartificial intelligence and other data-driven technologies in their lives.\n\u2022 OSTP issued a Request For Information (RFI) on the use and governance of biometric technologies.113 The\npurpose of this RFI was to understand the extent and variety of biometric technologies in past, current, or\nplanned use; the domains in which these technologies are being used; the entities making use of them; current\nprinciples, practices, or policies governing their use; and the stakeholders that are, or may be, impacted by their\nuse or regulation.

AI RMF pro\ufb01les assist organizations in deciding how to \nbest manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory \nrequirements and best practices, and re\ufb02ects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF \npro\ufb01les, this pro\ufb01le o\ufb00ers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle \nand for GAI as a technology.  \nAs GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document \nis an AI RMF cross-sectoral pro\ufb01le. Cross-sectoral pro\ufb01les can be used to govern, map, measure, and \nmanage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of \nlarge language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition. \nThis document de\ufb01nes risks that are novel to or exacerbated by the use of GAI. After introducing and \ndescribing these risks, the document provides a set of suggested actions to help organizations govern, \nmap, measure, and manage these risks. \n \n \n1 EO 14110 de\ufb01nes Generative AI as \u201cthe class of AI models that emulate the structure and characteristics of input \ndata in order to generate derived synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text, and other digital \ncontent.\u201d While not all GAI is derived from foundation models, for purposes of this document, GAI generally refers \nto generative foundation models. The foundation model subcategory of \u201cdual-use foundation models\u201d is de\ufb01ned by \nEO 14110 as \u201can AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of \nbillions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of contexts.\u201d  \n2 This pro\ufb01le was developed per Section 4.1(a)(i)(A) of EO 14110, which directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting \nthrough the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to develop a companion \nresource to the AI RMF, NIST AI 100\u20131, for generative AI.", "923bc40d-6b35-49e4-b881-0e4bd990bf7f": "2 \nThis work was informed by public feedback and consultations with diverse stakeholder groups as part of NIST\u2019s \nGenerative AI Public Working Group (GAI PWG). The GAI PWG was an open, transparent, and collaborative \nprocess, facilitated via a virtual workspace, to obtain multistakeholder input on GAI risk management and to \ninform NIST\u2019s approach. \nThe focus of the GAI PWG was limited to four primary considerations relevant to GAI: Governance, Content \nProvenance, Pre-deployment Testing, and Incident Disclosure (further described in Appendix A). As such, the \nsuggested actions in this document primarily address these considerations. \nFuture revisions of this pro\ufb01le will include additional AI RMF subcategories, risks, and suggested actions based \non additional considerations of GAI as the space evolves and empirical evidence indicates additional risks. A \nglossary of terms pertinent to GAI risk management will be developed and hosted on NIST\u2019s Trustworthy & \nResponsible AI Resource Center (AIRC), and added to The Language of Trustworthy AI: An In-Depth Glossary of \nTerms. \nThis document was also informed by public comments and consultations from several Requests for Information. \n \n2. \nOverview of Risks Unique to or Exacerbated by GAI \nIn the context of the AI RMF, risk refers to the composite measure of an event\u2019s probability (or \nlikelihood) of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. \nSome risks can be assessed as likely to materialize in a given context, particularly those that have been \nempirically demonstrated in similar contexts. Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given \ncontext, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain. \nAI risks can di\ufb00er from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI \nrisks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions: \n\u2022 \nStage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, \nand/or decommissioning. \n\u2022 \nScope: Risks may exist at individual model or system levels, at the application or implementation \nlevels (i.e., for a speci\ufb01c use case), or at the ecosystem level \u2013 that is, beyond a single system or \norganizational context. Examples of the latter include the expansion of \u201calgorithmic \nmonocultures,3\u201d resulting from repeated use of the same model, or impacts on access to \nopportunity, labor markets, and the creative economies.4 \n\u2022 \nSource of risk: Risks may emerge from factors related to the design, training, or operation of the \nGAI model itself, stemming in some cases from GAI model or system inputs, and in other cases, \nfrom GAI system outputs. Many GAI risks, however, originate from human behavior, including \n \n \n3 \u201cAlgorithmic monocultures\u201d refers to the phenomenon in which repeated use of the same model or algorithm in \nconsequential decision-making settings like employment and lending can result in increased susceptibility by \nsystems to correlated failures (like unexpected shocks), due to multiple actors relying on the same algorithm.  \n4 Many studies have projected the impact of AI on the workforce and labor markets. Fewer studies have examined \nthe impact of GAI on the labor market, though some industry surveys indicate that that both employees and \nemployers are pondering this disruption.", "037b09da-7a7d-4c0b-8e8d-01de90033968": "3 \nthe abuse, misuse, and unsafe repurposing by humans (adversarial or not), and others result \nfrom interactions between a human and an AI system.  \n\u2022 \nTime scale: GAI risks may materialize abruptly or across extended periods. Examples include \nimmediate (and/or prolonged) emotional harm and potential risks to physical safety due to the \ndistribution of harmful deepfake images, or the long-term e\ufb00ect of disinformation on societal \ntrust in public institutions. \nThe presence of risks and where they fall along the dimensions above will vary depending on the \ncharacteristics of the GAI model, system, or use case at hand. These characteristics include but are not \nlimited to GAI model or system architecture, training mechanisms and libraries, data types used for \ntraining or \ufb01ne-tuning, levels of model access or availability of model weights, and application or use \ncase context. \nOrganizations may choose to tailor how they measure GAI risks based on these characteristics. They may \nadditionally wish to allocate risk management resources relative to the severity and likelihood of \nnegative impacts, including where and how these risks manifest, and their direct and material impacts \nharms in the context of GAI use. Mitigations for model or system level risks may di\ufb00er from mitigations \nfor use-case or ecosystem level risks. \nImportantly, some GAI risks are unknown, and are therefore di\ufb03cult to properly scope or evaluate given \nthe uncertainty about potential GAI scale, complexity, and capabilities. Other risks may be known but \ndi\ufb03cult to estimate given the wide range of GAI stakeholders, uses, inputs, and outputs. Challenges with \nrisk estimation are aggravated by a lack of visibility into GAI training data, and the generally immature \nstate of the science of AI measurement and safety today. This document focuses on risks for which there \nis an existing empirical evidence base at the time this pro\ufb01le was written; for example, speculative risks \nthat may potentially arise in more advanced, future GAI systems are not considered. Future updates may \nincorporate additional risks or provide further details on the risks identi\ufb01ed below. \nTo guide organizations in identifying and managing GAI risks, a set of risks unique to or exacerbated by \nthe development and use of GAI are de\ufb01ned below.5 Each risk is labeled according to the outcome, \nobject, or source of the risk (i.e., some are risks \u201cto\u201d a subject or domain and others are risks \u201cof\u201d or \n\u201cfrom\u201d an issue or theme). These risks provide a lens through which organizations can frame and execute \nrisk management e\ufb00orts. To help streamline risk management e\ufb00orts, each risk is mapped in Section 3 \n(as well as in tables in Appendix B) to relevant Trustworthy AI Characteristics identi\ufb01ed in the AI RMF.  \n \n \n5 These risks can be further categorized by organizations depending on their unique approaches to risk de\ufb01nition \nand management. One possible way to further categorize these risks, derived in part from the UK\u2019s International \nScienti\ufb01c Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, could be: 1) Technical / Model risks (or risk from malfunction): \nConfabulation; Dangerous or Violent Recommendations; Data Privacy; Value Chain and Component Integration; \nHarmful Bias, and Homogenization; 2) Misuse by humans (or malicious use): CBRN Information or Capabilities; \nData Privacy; Human-AI Con\ufb01guration; Obscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content; Information Integrity; \nInformation Security; 3) Ecosystem / societal risks (or systemic risks): Data Privacy; Environmental; Intellectual \nProperty.

CBRN Information or Capabilities: Eased access to or synthesis of materially nefarious \ninformation or design capabilities related to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) \nweapons or other dangerous materials or agents. \n2.

Data Privacy: Impacts due to leakage and unauthorized use, disclosure, or de-anonymization of \nbiometric, health, location, or other personally identi\ufb01able information or sensitive data.7 \n5. Environmental Impacts: Impacts due to high compute resource utilization in training or \noperating GAI models, and related outcomes that may adversely impact ecosystems.  \n6. Harmful Bias or Homogenization: Ampli\ufb01cation and exacerbation of historical, societal, and \nsystemic biases; performance disparities8 between sub-groups or languages, possibly due to \nnon-representative training data, that result in discrimination, ampli\ufb01cation of biases, or \nincorrect presumptions about performance; undesired homogeneity that skews system or model \noutputs, which may be erroneous, lead to ill-founded decision-making, or amplify harmful \nbiases.  \n7. Human-AI Con\ufb01guration: Arrangements of or interactions between a human and an AI system \nwhich can result in the human inappropriately anthropomorphizing GAI systems or experiencing \nalgorithmic aversion, automation bias, over-reliance, or emotional entanglement with GAI \nsystems. \n8.

In discussing harms from disparities such as biased \nbehavior, this document highlights examples where someone\u2019s situation is worsened relative to what it would have \nbeen in the absence of any AI system, making the outcome unambiguously a harm of the system.", "e7b65d5e-e54e-4786-86e7-c25d74bd9147": "5 \noperations, or other cyberattacks; increased attack surface for targeted cyberattacks, which may \ncompromise a system\u2019s availability or the con\ufb01dentiality or integrity of training data, code, or \nmodel weights.  \n10.

CBRN Information or Capabilities \nIn the future, GAI may enable malicious actors to more easily access CBRN weapons and/or relevant \nknowledge, information, materials, tools, or technologies that could be misused to assist in the design, \ndevelopment, production, or use of CBRN weapons or other dangerous materials or agents. While \nrelevant biological and chemical threat knowledge and information is often publicly accessible, LLMs \ncould facilitate its analysis or synthesis, particularly by individuals without formal scienti\ufb01c training or \nexpertise.  \nRecent research on this topic found that LLM outputs regarding biological threat creation and attack \nplanning provided minimal assistance beyond traditional search engine queries, suggesting that state-of-\nthe-art LLMs at the time these studies were conducted do not substantially increase the operational \nlikelihood of such an attack. The physical synthesis development, production, and use of chemical or \nbiological agents will continue to require both applicable expertise and supporting materials and \ninfrastructure. The impact of GAI on chemical or biological agent misuse will depend on what the key \nbarriers for malicious actors are (e.g., whether information access is one such barrier), and how well GAI \ncan help actors address those barriers.  \nFurthermore, chemical and biological design tools (BDTs) \u2013 highly specialized AI systems trained on \nscienti\ufb01c data that aid in chemical and biological design \u2013 may augment design capabilities in chemistry \nand biology beyond what text-based LLMs are able to provide. As these models become more \ne\ufb03cacious, including for bene\ufb01cial uses, it will be important to assess their potential to be used for \nharm, such as the ideation and design of novel harmful chemical or biological agents.  \nWhile some of these described capabilities lie beyond the reach of existing GAI tools, ongoing \nassessments of this risk would be enhanced by monitoring both the ability of AI tools to facilitate CBRN \nweapons planning and GAI systems\u2019 connection or access to relevant data and tools. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristic: Safe, Explainable and Interpretable", "fafa159e-3984-402b-a9eb-6980fddf3cc0": "6 \n2.2. Confabulation \n\u201cConfabulation\u201d refers to a phenomenon in which GAI systems generate and con\ufb01dently present \nerroneous or false content in response to prompts. Confabulations also include generated outputs that \ndiverge from the prompts or other input or that contradict previously generated statements in the same \ncontext. These phenomena are colloquially also referred to as \u201challucinations\u201d or \u201cfabrications.\u201d \nConfabulations can occur across GAI outputs and contexts.9,10 Confabulations are a natural result of the \nway generative models are designed: they generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution \nof their training data; for example, LLMs predict the next token or word in a sentence or phrase. While \nsuch statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce \noutputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This dynamic is particularly relevant when \nit comes to open-ended prompts for long-form responses and in domains which require highly \ncontextual and/or domain expertise.  \nRisks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content \u2013 often due to the con\ufb01dent nature \nof the response \u2013 leading users to act upon or promote the false information. This poses a challenge for \nmany real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient \ninformation reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong \ntreatments. Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI \ninto applications involving consequential decision making. \nGAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the \nsystem\u2019s answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system\u2019s output. \nFor instance, LLMs sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the \nanswer itself is incorrect. Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, \npotentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human. \nThe extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the \npotential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study. Given the wide \nrange of downstream impacts of GAI, it is di\ufb03cult to estimate the downstream scale and impact of \nconfabulations. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Explainable \nand Interpretable \n2.3. Dangerous, Violent, or Hateful Content \nGAI systems can produce content that is inciting, radicalizing, or threatening, or that glori\ufb01es violence, \nwith greater ease and scale than other technologies. LLMs have been reported to generate dangerous or \nviolent recommendations, and some models have generated actionable instructions for dangerous or \n \n \n9 Confabulations of falsehoods are most commonly a problem for text-based outputs; for audio, image, or video \ncontent, creative generation of non-factual content can be a desired behavior.  \n10 For example, legal confabulations have been shown to be pervasive in current state-of-the-art LLMs. See also, \ne.g.,", "e3821ac8-8ecd-4dea-a143-5934a4d33200": "7 \nunethical behavior. Text-to-image models also make it easy to create images that could be used to \npromote dangerous or violent messages. Similar concerns are present for other GAI media, including \nvideo and audio. GAI may also produce content that recommends self-harm or criminal/illegal activities.  \nMany current systems restrict model outputs to limit certain content or in response to certain prompts, \nbut this approach may still produce harmful recommendations in response to other less-explicit, novel \nprompts (also relevant to CBRN Information or Capabilities, Data Privacy, Information Security, and \nObscene, Degrading and/or Abusive Content). Crafting such prompts deliberately is known as \n\u201cjailbreaking,\u201d or, manipulating prompts to circumvent output controls. Limitations of GAI systems can be \nharmful or dangerous in certain contexts. Studies have observed that users may disclose mental health \nissues in conversations with chatbots \u2013 and that users exhibit negative reactions to unhelpful responses \nfrom these chatbots during situations of distress. \nThis risk encompasses di\ufb03culty controlling creation of and public exposure to o\ufb00ensive or hateful \nlanguage, and denigrating or stereotypical content generated by AI. This kind of speech may contribute \nto downstream harm such as fueling dangerous or violent behaviors. The spread of denigrating or \nstereotypical content can also further exacerbate representational harms (see Harmful Bias and \nHomogenization below).  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Safe, Secure and Resilient \n2.4. Data Privacy \nGAI systems raise several risks to privacy. GAI system training requires large volumes of data, which in \nsome cases may include personal data. The use of personal data for GAI training raises risks to widely \naccepted privacy principles, including to transparency, individual participation (including consent), and \npurpose speci\ufb01cation. For example, most model developers do not disclose speci\ufb01c data sources on \nwhich models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identi\ufb01ably information (PII) \nwas trained on and, if so, how it was collected.  \nModels may leak, generate, or correctly infer sensitive information about individuals. For example, \nduring adversarial attacks, LLMs have revealed sensitive information (from the public domain) that was \nincluded in their training data. This problem has been referred to as data memorization, and may pose \nexacerbated privacy risks even for data present only in a small number of training samples.  \nIn addition to revealing sensitive information in GAI training data, GAI models may be able to correctly \ninfer PII or sensitive data that was not in their training data nor disclosed by the user by stitching \ntogether information from disparate sources. These inferences can have negative impact on an individual \neven if the inferences are not accurate (e.g., confabulations), and especially if they reveal information \nthat the individual considers sensitive or that is used to disadvantage or harm them. \nBeyond harms from information exposure (such as extortion or dignitary harm), wrong or inappropriate \ninferences of PII can contribute to downstream or secondary harmful impacts. For example, predictive \ninferences made by GAI models based on PII or protected attributes can contribute to adverse decisions, \nleading to representational or allocative harms to individuals or groups (see Harmful Bias and \nHomogenization below).", "d5001f5d-863d-47bf-841c-90aedf2173de": "8 \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and \nResilient \n2.5. Environmental Impacts \nTraining, maintaining, and operating (running inference on) GAI systems are resource-intensive activities, \nwith potentially large energy and environmental footprints. Energy and carbon emissions vary based on \nwhat is being done with the GAI model (i.e., pre-training, \ufb01ne-tuning, inference), the modality of the \ncontent, hardware used, and type of task or application. \nCurrent estimates suggest that training a single transformer LLM can emit as much carbon as 300 round-\ntrip \ufb02ights between San Francisco and New York. In a study comparing energy consumption and carbon \nemissions for LLM inference, generative tasks (e.g., text summarization) were found to be more energy- \nand carbon-intensive than discriminative or non-generative tasks (e.g., text classi\ufb01cation).  \nMethods for creating smaller versions of trained models, such as model distillation or compression, \ncould reduce environmental impacts at inference time, but training and tuning such models may still \ncontribute to their environmental impacts. Currently there is no agreed upon method to estimate \nenvironmental impacts from GAI.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Safe \n2.6. Harmful Bias and Homogenization \nBias exists in many forms and can become ingrained in automated systems. AI systems, including GAI \nsystems, can increase the speed and scale at which harmful biases manifest and are acted upon, \npotentially perpetuating and amplifying harms to individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and \nsociety. For example, when prompted to generate images of CEOs, doctors, lawyers, and judges, current \ntext-to-image models underrepresent women and/or racial minorities, and people with disabilities. \nImage generator models have also produced biased or stereotyped output for various demographic \ngroups and have di\ufb03culty producing non-stereotyped content even when the prompt speci\ufb01cally \nrequests image features that are inconsistent with the stereotypes. Harmful bias in GAI models, which \nmay stem from their training data, can also cause representational harms or perpetuate or exacerbate \nbias based on race, gender, disability, or other protected classes.  \nHarmful bias in GAI systems can also lead to harms via disparities between how a model performs for \ndi\ufb00erent subgroups or languages (e.g., an LLM may perform less well for non-English languages or \ncertain dialects). Such disparities can contribute to discriminatory decision-making or ampli\ufb01cation of \nexisting societal biases. In addition, GAI systems may be inappropriately trusted to perform similarly \nacross all subgroups, which could leave the groups facing underperformance with worse outcomes than \nif no GAI system were used. Disparate or reduced performance for lower-resource languages also \npresents challenges to model adoption, inclusion, and accessibility, and may make preservation of \nendangered languages more di\ufb03cult if GAI systems become embedded in everyday processes that would \notherwise have been opportunities to use these languages.  \nBias is mutually reinforcing with the problem of undesired homogenization, in which GAI systems \nproduce skewed distributions of outputs that are overly uniform (for example, repetitive aesthetic styles", "35c46ac1-ef75-486b-b14a-3117084c2562": "9 \nand reduced content diversity). Overly homogenized outputs can themselves be incorrect, or they may \nlead to unreliable decision-making or amplify harmful biases. These phenomena can \ufb02ow from \nfoundation models to downstream models and systems, with the foundation models acting as \n\u201cbottlenecks,\u201d or single points of failure.  \nOverly homogenized content can contribute to \u201cmodel collapse.\u201d Model collapse can occur when model \ntraining over-relies on synthetic data, resulting in data points disappearing from the distribution of the \nnew model\u2019s outputs. In addition to threatening the robustness of the model overall, model collapse \ncould lead to homogenized outputs, including by amplifying any homogenization from the model used to \ngenerate the synthetic training data. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Valid and Reliable \n2.7. Human-AI Con\ufb01guration \nGAI system use can involve varying risks of miscon\ufb01gurations and poor interactions between a system \nand a human who is interacting with it. Humans bring their unique perspectives, experiences, or domain-\nspeci\ufb01c expertise to interactions with AI systems but may not have detailed knowledge of AI systems and \nhow they work. As a result, human experts may be unnecessarily \u201caverse\u201d to GAI systems, and thus \ndeprive themselves or others of GAI\u2019s bene\ufb01cial uses.  \nConversely, due to the complexity and increasing reliability of GAI technology, over time, humans may \nover-rely on GAI systems or may unjusti\ufb01ably perceive GAI content to be of higher quality than that \nproduced by other sources. This phenomenon is an example of automation bias, or excessive deference \nto automated systems. Automation bias can exacerbate other risks of GAI, such as risks of confabulation \nor risks of bias or homogenization. \nThere may also be concerns about emotional entanglement between humans and GAI systems, which \ncould lead to negative psychological impacts. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Explainable and Interpretable, Fair with \nHarmful Bias Managed, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Valid and Reliable \n2.8. Information Integrity \nInformation integrity describes the \u201cspectrum of information and associated patterns of its creation, \nexchange, and consumption in society.\u201d High-integrity information can be trusted; \u201cdistinguishes fact \nfrom \ufb01ction, opinion, and inference; acknowledges uncertainties; and is transparent about its level of \nvetting. This information can be linked to the original source(s) with appropriate evidence. High-integrity \ninformation is also accurate and reliable, can be veri\ufb01ed and authenticated, has a clear chain of custody, \nand creates reasonable expectations about when its validity may expire.\u201d11 \n \n \n11 This de\ufb01nition of information integrity is derived from the 2022 White House Roadmap for Researchers on \nPriorities Related to Information Integrity Research and Development.", "541fa58d-0d5b-4dba-85a9-a52deb58d91f": "10 \nGAI systems can ease the unintentional production or dissemination of false, inaccurate, or misleading \ncontent (misinformation) at scale, particularly if the content stems from confabulations.  \nGAI systems can also ease the deliberate production or dissemination of false or misleading information \n(disinformation) at scale, where an actor has the explicit intent to deceive or cause harm to others. Even \nvery subtle changes to text or images can manipulate human and machine perception. \nSimilarly, GAI systems could enable a higher degree of sophistication for malicious actors to produce \ndisinformation that is targeted towards speci\ufb01c demographics. Current and emerging multimodal models \nmake it possible to generate both text-based disinformation and highly realistic \u201cdeepfakes\u201d \u2013 that is, \nsynthetic audiovisual content and photorealistic images.12 Additional disinformation threats could be \nenabled by future GAI models trained on new data modalities. \nDisinformation and misinformation \u2013 both of which may be facilitated by GAI \u2013 may erode public trust in \ntrue or valid evidence and information, with downstream e\ufb00ects. For example, a synthetic image of a \nPentagon blast went viral and brie\ufb02y caused a drop in the stock market. Generative AI models can also \nassist malicious actors in creating compelling imagery and propaganda to support disinformation \ncampaigns, which may not be photorealistic, but could enable these campaigns to gain more reach and \nengagement on social media platforms. Additionally, generative AI models can assist malicious actors in \ncreating fraudulent content intended to impersonate others. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Safe, Valid and Reliable, Interpretable and \nExplainable \n2.9. Information Security \nInformation security for computer systems and data is a mature \ufb01eld with widely accepted and \nstandardized practices for o\ufb00ensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two \nprimary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by \nlowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of o\ufb00ensive capabilities; simultaneously, it \nexpands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data \npoisoning.  \nO\ufb00ensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as \nhacking, malware, and phishing. Reports have indicated that LLMs are already able to discover some \nvulnerabilities in systems (hardware, software, data) and write code to exploit them. Sophisticated threat \nactors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of \nthe attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate \nprivileges after gaining system access. \nInformation security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system \nand the integrity and (when applicable) the con\ufb01dentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model \nweights. To identify and secure potential attack points in AI systems or speci\ufb01c components of the AI \n \n \n12 See also https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.100-4, to be published.", "716cbd59-aaa1-4727-8424-fb9de0a539c3": "11 \nvalue chain (e.g., data inputs, processing, GAI training, or deployment environments), conventional \ncybersecurity practices may need to adapt or evolve. \nFor instance, prompt injection involves modifying what input is provided to a GAI system so that it \nbehaves in unintended ways. In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious prompts and \ninput them directly to a GAI system, with a variety of downstream negative consequences to \ninterconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without \na direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be \nretrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit \nvulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely \nquerying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model. \nAnother cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training \ndataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation. Malicious tampering with data or parts \nof the model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs. \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient, Valid and Reliable \n2.10. \nIntellectual Property \nIntellectual property risks from GAI systems may arise where the use of copyrighted works is not a fair \nuse under the fair use doctrine. If a GAI system\u2019s training data included copyrighted material, GAI \noutputs displaying instances of training data memorization (see Data Privacy above) could infringe on \ncopyright. \nHow GAI relates to copyright, including the status of generated content that is similar to but does not \nstrictly copy work protected by copyright, is currently being debated in legal fora. Similar discussions are \ntaking place regarding the use or emulation of personal identity, likeness, or voice without permission.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Privacy \nEnhanced  \n2.11. \nObscene, Degrading, and/or Abusive Content \nGAI can ease the production of and access to illegal non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) of adults, \nand/or child sexual abuse material (CSAM). GAI-generated obscene, abusive or degrading content can \ncreate privacy, psychological and emotional, and even physical harms, and in some cases may be illegal.  \nGenerated explicit or obscene AI content may include highly realistic \u201cdeepfakes\u201d of real individuals, \nincluding children. The spread of this kind of material can have downstream negative consequences: in \nthe context of CSAM, even if the generated images do not resemble speci\ufb01c individuals, the prevalence \nof such images can divert time and resources from e\ufb00orts to \ufb01nd real-world victims. Outside of CSAM, \nthe creation and spread of NCII disproportionately impacts women and sexual minorities, and can have \nsubsequent negative consequences including decline in overall mental health, substance abuse, and \neven suicidal thoughts.  \nData used for training GAI models may unintentionally include CSAM and NCII. A recent report noted \nthat several commonly used GAI training datasets were found to contain hundreds of known images of", "1f3dd5b0-9129-451b-8948-3bed50657459": "12 \nCSAM. Even when trained on \u201cclean\u201d data, increasingly capable GAI models can synthesize or produce \nsynthetic NCII and CSAM. Websites, mobile apps, and custom-built models that generate synthetic NCII \nhave moved from niche internet forums to mainstream, automated, and scaled online businesses.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Safe, Privacy Enhanced \n2.12. \nValue Chain and Component Integration \nGAI value chains involve many third-party components such as procured datasets, pre-trained models, \nand software libraries. These components might be improperly obtained or not properly vetted, leading \nto diminished transparency or accountability for downstream users. While this is a risk for traditional AI \nsystems and some other digital technologies, the risk is exacerbated for GAI due to the scale of the \ntraining data, which may be too large for humans to vet; the di\ufb03culty of training foundation models, \nwhich leads to extensive reuse of limited numbers of models; and the extent to which GAI may be \nintegrated into other devices and services. As GAI systems often involve many distinct third-party \ncomponents and data sources, it may be di\ufb03cult to attribute issues in a system\u2019s behavior to any one of \nthese sources. \nErrors in third-party GAI components can also have downstream impacts on accuracy and robustness. \nFor example, test datasets commonly used to benchmark or validate models can contain label errors. \nInaccuracies in these labels can impact the \u201cstability\u201d or robustness of these benchmarks, which many \nGAI practitioners consider during the model selection process.  \nTrustworthy AI Characteristics: Accountable and Transparent, Explainable and Interpretable, Fair with \nHarmful Bias Managed, Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient, Valid and Reliable \n3. \nSuggested Actions to Manage GAI Risks \nThe following suggested actions target risks unique to or exacerbated by GAI. \nIn addition to the suggested actions below, AI risk management activities and actions set forth in the AI \nRMF 1.0 and Playbook are already applicable for managing GAI risks.
